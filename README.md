<p align="center">
I focus on the intersection of **Infrastructure Efficiency** and **Observability Governance**. My goal is to bridge the gap between "Storing Everything" and "Understanding Anything."

### Current Focus: [Clarvynn](https://github.com/Clarvynn/Clarvynn)
**Status:** *Active Development*

I am building **Clarvynn**, an open-source initiative to solve "Telemetry Sprawl" at the source.

* **The Thesis:** Moving governance **upstream** (into the application runtime) is more efficient than filtering **downstream** (at the Collector/Database).
* **The Tech:** A Python-based OTel adapter that sits in-process to curate high-fidelity signals before serialization.
* **The Goal:** Eliminate the "Serialization Tax" and give developers control over their observability budget via **Telemetry Contracts**.



--> **[Check out the Repository](https://github.com/Clarvynn/Clarvynn)** to see the architecture and roadmap.

### Engineering Philosophy

* **Signals > Noise:** Observability is a data quality problem, not just a storage pricing problem.
* **Source Governance:** The service owner knows the intent of a log; the SRE only knows the cost. Governance belongs where the intent lives.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** If it isn't defined in code (or a contract), it doesn't exist.

### The Toolbox

* **Observability:** OpenTelemetry (OTLP), Prometheus, Grafana, Distributed Tracing
* **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Azure, GCP
* **Languages:** Python, Bash
* **Practices:** FinOps, Performance Engineering
