## Current Project

### Clarvynn - Observability Governance Platform

**The problem:** Teams generate terabytes of telemetry they know is wasteful (health checks, debug logs, routine operations), but have no easy way to control what gets created.

**The solution:** Policy-based governance at the source - before data enters pipelines or backends.

**What's built:**
- Python OTEL adapter for tail-based sampling at SDK level
- Support for Flask, Django, FastAPI applications
- Policy language (CPL) for defining capture/suppress rules
- Works with any OTLP-compatible backend

**Current status:** Validating with pilot customer for production deployment.

**Open source. Apache 2.0.**
