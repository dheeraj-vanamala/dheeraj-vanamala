## What I'm Building

**Clarvynn** – A first-of-its-kind Telemetry as Code platform  
- Enables engineers to define and enforce telemetry generation through structured, version-controlled configuration  
- Brings observability under source control with consistent behavior across environments  
- Supports OpenTelemetry standards, including trace-metric correlation and exemplars  
- Designed to suppress low-signal noise at the source, reducing vendor and infra costs by up to 90%  
- Helps teams retain full visibility into meaningful events without overwhelming their systems or budgets

## Areas of Focus

- Observability Platforms (Prometheus, Mimir, Grafana, Tempo, OpenTelemetry)  
- Infrastructure as Code and GitOps (Terraform, ArgoCD, CI/CD pipelines)  
- Distributed Systems, Service Instrumentation, and Cost Optimization  
- Python and Go-based backend engineering  
- Developer platforms and production-grade system design
